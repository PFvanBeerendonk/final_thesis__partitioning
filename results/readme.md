## Tuning
As explained in the paper, we first tuned the weights and then the params. During tuning, the program was tasked to terminate if it ever reached 12 parts.

The folder `weights` contain the results as detailed in table 4.1, 4.2. While the folder `params` details the runs for table 4.3, 4.4.

## Results
